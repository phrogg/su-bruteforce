# su-bruteforce with wordlist

This tool **bruteforces a selected user** using `su` and as passwords: **null password, username, reverse username and your wordlist.**

By **default** the BF default speed is using 100 su processes at the same time (each su try last 0.7s and a new su try in 0.007s). It **needs 143s to complete**.

You can configure these times using `-t` (timeout `su` process) and `-s` (sleep between 2 `su` processes). 

**Fastest recommendation**: `-t 0.5` (minimun acceptable) and `-s 0.003` ~ **108s to complete.**
```
./suBF.sh -u <USERNAME> -l <PWLIST> [-t 0.7] [-s 0.007]
```
